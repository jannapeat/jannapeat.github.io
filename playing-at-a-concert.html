<h1>Playing a Concert</h1>
  
<p class="top-tip">If you hit a wrong note or make a mistake, don't stop playing - just carry on and look as though you mean it!</p>
<p>Playing a Concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time...</p>
<p>So we have put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p>
<h2>Copy Out a Set-List</h2>
<p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you will play them in.
<p>Make copies for everyone!</p>
<p>Print <strong>BIG!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
<h2>Remember your spares</h2>
<p>Some intruments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>guitar strings</li>
<li>saxaphone or clarinet reeds</li>
<li>drumsticks</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Make a list of the spares you might need and make sure you kno where they are in an emergency.</p>
  
<h2>Plan where you will be on the stage</h2>
  
<p>Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Will the drums be on centre stage? Or off to the side?</li>
<li>Is there a power-socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
</ul>
  
<p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your intruments. It's really annoying if you 
have to start unplugging things and swapping things places once you've begun to set things up!</p>
  
<h2>Know where you're going, know when you're on</h2>
  
<p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the sat-nav 
before you set out. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfamiliar place half-an-hour before you're due to go onstage.</p>
<p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. On the night, times 
often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Dont get caught out!</p>
