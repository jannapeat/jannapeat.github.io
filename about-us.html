	<h2>Dani - Singer Extrodinaire</h2>
	<p>
	<img class="small" src="images/dani.jpg" alt="Picture of Dani"/>
	</p>
	<p>Dani is the Triple Ds singer. She likes to sing all the time - not just when
	she is playing with the Triple Ds! Her mum and dad say she learned to sing before
	she learned to talk!</p>

	<h2>Deeg - If its got strings, she'll play it!</h2>
	<p> <img class="small" src="images/deeg.jpg" alt="Picture of Deeg"/>
	</p>
	<p>Acoustic guitar? Electric lead guitar? Ukelele? Harp? Deeg can play them all. 
	She started off by making homemade guitars from carboard boxes and elastic 
	bands till her uncle took pity on her and brought her a Spanish Guitar for 
	Christmas. After a few lessons at school she was flying!</p>

	<section>
	<h2>Donna - One Woman Rythm Section</h2>
	<p> <img class="small" src="images/donna.jpg" alt="Picture of Donna"/>
	</p>
	<p>Donna has had music in her blood from the day she was born. Both her mum 
	and dad play instruments and got her her first drum kit when she was only 
	five years old, which led to trouble with the neighbours. On some songs she will
	play the bass guitar and on others she will play the drums. She loves playing 
	in the Tr Ds but hates carrying her drumkit around.</p>
